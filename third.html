    Here is my own cat, Raven!
    </header>
            <main>
                <p> Raven is an 8 month old domestic shorthair with a tortieshell coat. She was a spur of the moment purchase from a friend whose own cat had gotten pregnant from a stray male. I like to think I rescued her from the family since she would've been one of many, many cats. With me, she is pretty spoiled.  </p>

                <div class="image-row">
                    <img src="raven.JPG" alt="super cute cat." height="300px">

                </div>

                <p>  While you may think, "Oh what a cute cat she must be so perfect!" Wrong. Raven is a little menace. She is particualrly interested in climbing everything, from shower curtains, to fridges, and even tv screens. She will find a way on top of everything. She also loves to roll around in her dirty litter box as soon as I go to clean to it, which makes the process much more tedious than it actually is. She craves attention every mornning at 6:30am sharp, also not ideal when I try to sleep in. However, despite all her shennanigans, she is adorable and very hard to stay upset with.</p>
                <p> Of course I had to mention my original kitty, Tinkerbelle. Tinkerbelle or "Tinka" is my family's cat who is currently 18 years old turning 19 in January! She is a cuddly grandma now but she was once a crazy kitten too. Unfortunately, her and Raven do not get along because Raven's a bit too energentic. Hopefully, once Raven has calmed down a bit her Tinka can become better friends. Until then, the two can only watch eachother from afar. Tinkerbelle is quite large for a cat weight wise, most likely leading to her recent diagnosis of diabetes. She is doing much better now but for about a year she recieved two insulin shots a day and had a lexicom. Despite that, she has been living a great life!</p>
