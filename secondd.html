    Lets get into some cat breeds!

        <main>
            <p> One of my favorite cat breeds that I hope to own one day is the Maine Coon. Maine Coons are known for there gigantic size, growing up to 40 inches long from nose to tail! This is as large as some small to medium sized dogs. Their long coats and big bodies would make them the perfect cuddle buddy. </p>

                </div>
            <p> Another very common breed is the domestic shorthair. They are known for being a mixed breed, almost like the "mutt" of cats. They can come in all different colors and sizes, so there is a lot of variety for new cat owners.  </p>

                </div>
            <p> Another adorable and very popular breed is the ragdoll. These kittys are known for their lazy nature and cuddly personality. They are also very poualr for their long, white coats and blue eyes. If you want a super easy cat to snuggle up with then a ragdoll is the cat for you! </p>
